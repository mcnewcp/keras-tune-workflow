# Purpose
This repo houses my workflow for tuning Keras models.  The workflow includes:
- tracking experiments using [mlflow](https://mlflow.org/)
- optimizing hyperparemters using [hyperopt](http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/)

# Contents
This repo is currently a work in progress but I'm planning for it to include extendable functions and/or classes for use across my projects.
